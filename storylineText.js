  startingLine: "You wake up in your usual dumpster. There is another bird next to you.Her eyes are closed. What do you do?",
  peckTheFemale: "You pecked the female bird. She screeches, pecks you, and flies away. Dang. You hop to the gas station and see Bucky Adams, the guy who always loiters in front of the gas station and has no idea what to do with his hands. What do you do?",
  peckBuckyAdams:"'Ow! That smarts!' Bucky Adams said as you pecked him. 'Alright! Alright! I'll get out of the way!' He shakes his fist in the air for some reason, even though you are at foot level. Upon realization, you see that he’s wearing sandals. A zombie invasion is about to happen, and the guy is wearing sandals. But hey, I’m not the one to judge. You stammer into the gas station. It's quite busy. A lot of people are buying snack food and beer for the incoming zombie invasion. In moments like these, you’re glad you're a bird and that your diet consists of just worms and bugs. You waltz into the gas station. Everyone stares at you as if you were a freak. You bump into a family of four in the chip aisle. What do you do?",
  peckFamily: "You peck at the child, which causes all of them to hunch on the floor and scream. What the heck? They’re zombies! Your pecking broke their disguise! Their screeching alerts everyone in the gas station. No one has ever considered the paradigm or possibility that zombies could infiltrate the modern fabric of society this easily. Everyone’s knowledge of zombies has been shaped by Hollywood, but in reality, zombies are much more subversive and pervasive. But you did a real good job pecking that family. As a result of your pecking, the entire gas station has now been introduced to the enemy that is about to befall them. The fella in the other aisle walks over to you, looks down at you, and gives you a fist bump. You believe he’s an FBI agent because the back of his jacket says FBI in big yellow letters. He says, 'You sure showed those zombies who’s boss.' He laughs at his own comment like it was the funniest punchline ever. What do you do?",
  peckFBI:`"Those are some gnarly moves!" The FBI agent yells in a voice that is most definitely not an inside voice. "I can do better!" He starts pecking at you—much better than you can peck him, actually. The FBI agent squats on his knees and aggressively starts pecking at you. You get ruffled up a bit. Thankfully, this is more embarrassing for him than for you, because you’re a nameless bird who doesn’t have much standing in the world—at least not compared to the FBI, who is pelting his lips on you. You become more conscious of your own pecking ability, and now you can "peck" people twice. You leave the FBI agent, never to see him again, because, thanks to his "playful affection" with you, he has now contracted bird flu. A very potent strain, since your home is the back dumpster. Dumpster Bird Flu. Oh goodness, I wouldn’t wish that upon my worst enemy. But at least you learned how to peck things twice now.`,
  peckDarcy:`“What are you doing? Ow! What are you doing? Stop!” The janitor Darcy whacks you with his broom. Ouch. The janitor stays inside and returns to sweeping. “Pesky bird! Pesky, pesky bird!” A stray cat lingers at the entrance of the gas station, meowing and hissing. Uh oh. It’s hungry, and you’re the most appetizing thing in the gas station. What do you do?`,
  peckCat:`You peck at the cat. It swipes at you hard. Ouch. You feel very lethargic. Yikes! The cat gives up on eating you and grabs a bag of peanuts from across the aisle. Suddenly, a very large man with a dapper mustache screams. Everyone in the gas station looks at him. Well, well, well, it’s Mr. Tabacco himself! What do you do?`,
  peckMrTabacco:`The second you start to peck at Mr. Tabacco, his security rushes in and pins you down. Once they realize that you’re just a bird, they let you go. They confiscate all your cigarettes. Nice going. Why would you peck at Mr. Tabacco? A guy completely decked out in camo stands at the checkout, buying a can of Pringles and about 40 cans of soup to prepare for the incoming zombie invasion that is about to wreak havoc on the entire city. What do you do?`,
  peckDoomsdayPrepper:`The doomsday prepper breaks down crying. Not even I, the omnipresent narrator, can explain why. He leaves the gas station, abandoning all those cans of soup and Pringles at the checkout lane. I suppose it’s yours to enjoy now. You recover a bit of health points. The clerk and you exchange a glance and shrug. Whatever. The food is now dispersed for all to enjoy. What a treat! You can hear the incoming swarm of zombies crawl and moan. A foul stench fills the gas station. The tension is palpable. You hop into the next aisle and see Mr. Heart, the gas station’s mascot, dancing and cheering, oblivious to the impending doom.`,
  peckMrHeart:`“Get out. I did not give you permission to touch me.” Mr. Heart’s cartoon voice devolves into a stern, grouchy, almost startling tenor. You really think Mr. Heart is about to attack you until you hear a voice over the intercom. “Attention, customers. The zombies have taken control of the streets. Everyone left in the gas station, we will be handing out bats and hammers. Please, if you find room in your heart, help us fend off this oncoming horde.” Mr. Heart and you exchange glances. “We will settle this later. For now, this is the pivotal moment—the one that will define everything. At least for me. Perhaps for you, it’s just another fleeting concern, because that’s the type of person…bird…you are. I don’t hate you for it. It’s in your nature, after all, to remain indifferent to the struggles of humans. But now, I beg you, bird—help us. Help us face the relentless tide of the undead. Do this, and maybe, just maybe, we stand a chance.” A heavy silence hangs between you two. In that moment, something shifts—a silent understanding. For now, you are allies. Together, you walk toward the clerk at the cash register, your fate tied to the chaos unfolding outside.`,
  peckGasStationClerk:`The clerk, startled by your sudden pecking, stumbles back, his focus completely shattered. The battle strategy, once carefully crafted, begins to unravel in the wake of your distraction. “Why is this bird still here? Can someone get him out?” he demands, frustration evident in his voice. Well done. You’ve managed to pull everyone's attention away from the task at hand, wasting precious moments that could have been used to prepare for the impending chaos. The seconds tick away, each one heavier than the last. Now, with the gas station in disarray, the true test begins: how will they fare against the oncoming zombie horde?`,
  //cig options
  cigTheFemale:`The bird beside you freaked out when you offered her a cigarette. She grabbed it and flew off without a word. Guess that’s how it goes—no good deed goes unpunished. You’re craving a Monster Energy Drink or a Red Bull, so you crawl out of the dumpster you’ve been sleeping in and waddle into the gas station. Outside, Bucky Adams is loitering near the entrance, muttering to himself as usual. What do you do?`,
  cigBuckyAdams: `"Thanks for the cig! It’s not every day a bird bums me a cigarette. That’s so cool. I didn’t even know they made birds like that. You know what would be even cooler? If there was a bird trained to give two cigarettes. I’d just about explode with excitement if that ever happened to me. Anyway, thanks. You’re really cool." That was Bucky Adams. He always seems happy. The idea of a bird giving two cigarettes lingers in your mind—what a concept. You waltz into the gas station. Everyone is staring at your friend, Bucky Adams. He had just celebrated one year of being cigarette-free—until now. You bump into a family of four in the chip aisle. What do you do?`,
  cigFamily:`As you extend your wing out to offer them a cigarette, you realize that they are actually a family of undercover zombies! They snag your wing with their teeth. Ouch! Your screaming alarms the nearby person who was scoping out the aisle for some peanuts. Oh, thank goodness, the fella in the other aisle just happened to be an FBI agent. He says, "Ah gee, that was a close one, wouldn't you say?" And, of course, he is wearing aviators. What sort of FBI agent isn't wearing aviators? What do you do?`,
  cigFBIAgent:`"Thanks! I love candy!" The FBI agent eats the cigarette. Has he never seen a cigarette before? Odd. I mean, I guess the purpose of a cigarette isn’t exactly intuitive, but I would’ve thought an FBI agent of all people would know how cigarettes work. Am I alone in thinking that? I don’t want to come off as too harsh here. The FBI agent thanks you, but you can tell from his constant spitting on the floor that he’s just being polite. Good for him. He runs off into the gas station bathroom. You make eye contact with the janitor. Uh oh. You don't remember if this gas station accepts birds or not. What do you do?`,
  cigDarcy:`"You’re too kind!" The janitor places the cigarette in his pocket. "I am going to enjoy this bad baby later. I won’t tell anyone that you’re in here. Birds deserve to loiter in gas stations as much as anyone else. Once again, thank you for giving me—a humble, young child like me—a cigarette. Now, please allow me to make sure this gas station is pristine. You’ve motivated me to stop being so lazy!"The janitor stays inside. A stray cat sneaks into the gas station, meowing and hissing. Uh oh. It’s hungry, and you’re the most appetizing thing in sight. What do you do?`,
  cigCat:`What are you doing? Why would you give that cat a cigarette? Are you trying to waste all your cigarettes? Nice survival instincts you got there. The cat swipes at you. Ouch. And it does it again. Super Ouch. Suddenly, a very large man with a dapper mustache screams. Everyone in the gas station looks at him. Well, well, well, it is Mr. Tabacco himself. What do you do?`,
  cigTabacco: `"Thanks." Mr. Tabacco lights the cigarette and shares it with the bird. The bird calms down. You and Mr. Tabacco hang out. "Even though you’re a bird, you’ve got pretty good vibes." Mr. Tabacco pushes up his million-dollar aviator sunglasses. "I heard there’s a zombie invasion going on. You seem cool. I’ll park my car here and help out wherever needed. We’ve got a bunch of… well, don’t worry about it. You’ll be set with my team around. Be sure to hunker down here. I hope everyone else here is as like-minded as you are, kind bird. Most people see that I’m the CEO of every cigarette company in the country and assume I have plenty of cigarettes on hand. But the truth is, I don’t. So thank you for your friendship. I’ll never forget this moment. You and Mr. Tabacco form a friendship that will last for eons. After all that, you hop around the gas station and you see a doomsday prepper make a scene at the cash register. What do you do?"`,
  cigZombiePrepper: `“Dude, is this some sort of joke? This is my fourth year of quitting, and you do this? I’m out of here.” The zombie prepper buys his can of Pringles™ and runs out of the store. He abruptly runs back in and kicks you. Ouch! You can hear the incoming swarm of zombies crawl and moan. A fetid stench fills the gas station. The tension is palpable. You hop into the next aisle and see Mr. Heart, the gas station’s mascot, dancing and cheering, oblivious to the impending doom.`,
  cigMrHeart: `“I would prefer it if you left my store. You are but a stranger to me, and I to you. Why, then, would I accept these cigarettes from you?” Mr. Heart beats his chest with a single, slow motion, his gaze cold and piercing as he points to the exit. Inside the fridge, you hear Bucky speak over the intercom. “Attention customers, the zombies have taken control of the streets. Everyone still in the gas station, we will be handing out bats and hammers. Please, if you can find room in your heart, help us fend off this oncoming horde.”`,
  cigCasStationClerk: `…Is this it? Uh, thanks. `,

  peckDarcyTwice:`"That tickles! Ha, you're a funny bird. Stop pecking me! If you peck me one more time, I’m going to whack you with my mop. Thanks for not giving me any cigarettes, though. I see you've got ${cigarettesRemaining} left. I get really crazy if I have nicotine or whatever they call it. Who knows how I would’ve acted if you’d given me one—or even two!" He pauses, then shakes his head. "I should probably just abstain from smoking for the rest of my life. Imagine the dark timeline you just prevented by not giving me any cigarettes! Cigars? Maybe someday, though!", What a weirdo. Darcy checks his watch. "Oh, it’s time for my break." With that, he leaves you behind, heading off for a well-deserved respite.`,
  peckCatTwice:`Good job! Your pecking really scares the cat away. Did you know that outdoor cats are disastrous to typical bird populations? In fact, they are responsible for the deaths of nearly 2.4 billion birds annually in the U.S. alone. Many of those birds are vulnerable, with species like the California Condor and Piping Plover facing extinction due to factors like habitat loss and predation. Way to stand up for yourself, even at a statistical disadvantage. As a reward, God grants you an extra cigarette to give out to people. Suddenly, a very large man with a dapper mustache screams, drawing the attention of everyone in the gas station. Well, well, well... it’s Mr. Tabacco himself. What do you do?`,
  peckMrTabaccoTwice:`The second you start to peck at Mr. Tabacco, his security rushes in and pins you down. Once they realize you're just a bird, they release you, but Mr. Tabacco stops them. “Hold on. This bird,” he says, his eyes narrowing as he inspects you closely. “Who taught you that move? To peck me twice?” He looks alarmed at his security team, and in a sudden realization, he says, “The FBI?” The security staff scrambles, looking at each other nervously.“Look here, bird,” Mr. Tabacco continues. “I’m sorry for any damage my guys have done to you. We’re all set now, right?” He kneels down, pulling out a cracker, and gently offers it to you. As you take it, you feel your health completely restored, your HP back to full. As you nibble on your snack, a man decked out in camouflage approaches the checkout. He's buying a can of Pringles and about 40 cans of soup, clearly preparing for the incoming zombie invasion that’s about to ravage the city. What do you do?`,
  peckDoomsdayPrepperTwice:`“What a cute little birdie you are!” The Zombie Prepper rubs his nose all over you for some reason and kisses you on the wings. Ack. He might regret doing that later, but for now, you provide him a sweet reprieve from whatever demons have been possessing him. For some reason, a bass player starts strumming, and a trumpeter strides into the gas station. “My guys are here. Finally. Hey, Louie Two-Times!” The trumpeter stops mid-step. "That here is my special buddy, Louie Two-Times. He just got out of the slammer, and now we’re gonna go fight some zombies, playa. Give this bird some C4. The little guy is gonna need it.” The trumpeter hands you a whole bunch of C4. You can barely carry it on your wings. This may help later. The air grows thick with tension as you hear the incoming swarm of zombies crawling and moaning. A foetor creeps into the gas station. The atmosphere is charged with dread. You hop into the next aisle, only to spot Mr. Heart, the gas station’s mascot, still dancing and cheering, blissfully unaware of the impending doom.`,
  peckMrHeartTwice:`“GET OUT. GET OUT. DO NOT TOUCH ME!” Mr. Heart grabs you by your talons and throws you across the store. The clerk hops over his cash register and restrains Mr. Heart. The FBI agent from before steps out of the bathroom and drops his phone. It bounces across the floor. “Mr. Heart. I have spent the entirety of my career looking for you.” The FBI agent and Mr. Heart brawl. You hide in the beer fridge waiting for the commotion to stop. The two take it outside, and you never hear from them again.Inside the fridge, you hear the gas station clerk speak over the intercom. “Attention customers, the zombies have taken control of the streets. Everyone who is left in the gas station, we will be handing out bats and hammers. Please, if you find room in your heart, help us fend off this oncoming horde.You hop up onto the counter. Instead of chips and soda, there are hammers and clubs.`,
  peckGasStationClerkTwice:`Everyone laughs and smiles as you peck the clerk’s hand two times. The tension melts away, and the mood lightens, as people become less stressed about the zombie invasion. You flutter around the gas station, pecking everyone as they prepare for combat. One guy starts crying. Sheesh, take it down a notch. But aside from that, everyone is suiting up for the fight. “Let’s get going!” the clerk shouts, rallying the group.Bucky Adams pumps his fist in the air, ready for action. Darcy wields his mop like a true warrior, determined to defend the station. And as for you? Well, all you can do is fly and watch—after all, you’re just a bird. No offense.The battle is about to begin, but how will it all end?`,

  cigFamilyTwice:`As you extend your wing to offer them two cigarettes, you suddenly realize that they’re actually a family of undercover zombies! In a flash, they lunge and snag your wing with their teeth. Ouch! Your screams echo through the store, catching the attention of someone in the next aisle who had been browsing for peanuts. Thankfully, the person turns out to be an FBI agent. He looks over at you and says, "Well, that was a close one, wouldn't you say?"`,
  cigFBIAgentTwice:`The FBI agent grabs both cigarettes and eats them. Has he never seen a cigarette before? Odd. I mean, the purpose of a cigarette isn't exactly intuitive, but you'd think an FBI agent would know how they work. Maybe giving him two at once threw him off. Either way, you’ve just wasted a cigarette. The agent looks like he’s about to puke, and in a panic, he scrambles out of the store, disappearing from view. Probably for the better—if the next FBI agent you encounter is him, you're in trouble. Soon after, a janitor with the name tag "Darcy" watches you walk past the soda machine. What do you do?`,
  cigDarcyTwice:`"Wow, not many people give me cigarettes because I’m only 14," the janitor says with a grin. "Thanks!" He sets down his mop and lets you hop up onto his arm. "I’m Darcy, by the way. I’m in 8th grade. I really wish I didn’t have to work at this dumb gas station. Did you see the news? A zombie apocalypse is about to hit, but here I am, still working. Hey, do you  have any more cigarettes? Nah, never mind. You've given me enough. I'm gonna head outside and enjoy these bad boys. Hopefully, I won’t get mauled to death by zombies!" Darcy pats you on the head and gently sets you down. Suddenly, a black cat sniffs you. Holy cow, you didn’t sense that cat come in. A wet nose and twitching whiskers tickle your feathers. What do you do?`,
  cigCatTwice:`What are you doing? Why would you give that cat a cigarette, let alone two? Are you trying to waste all your cigarettes? Nice survival instincts you’ve got there. The cat swipes at you. Ouch. And it does it again. Super ouch. Did you know that outdoor cats kill an estimated 2.4 billion birds in the U.S. every year? That’s about 6.6 million birds a day, or nearly 274,000 birds per hour. And don’t think this is just the occasional bird—they target small songbirds, shorebirds, and even some species of endangered birds. It's been estimated that domestic cats kill 13.7 billion animals in total annually, including mammals and reptiles. So, yeah, this cat’s definitely not one to trust with your cigarettes. Suddenly, a very large man with a dapper mustache screams at the cashier, drawing everyone’s attention in the gas station. Well, well, well... it’s Mr. Tabacco himself. What do you do?`,
  cigTabaccoTwice: `Mr. Tabacco frowns at the bird, tosses the cigarettes into the trash, and immediately turns around, storming out of the gas station. "I hate brown-nosers," he mutters under his breath. Meanwhile, a guy decked out head to toe in camo stands at the checkout, buying a can of Pringles and about 40 cans of soup. He’s preparing for the incoming zombie invasion that’s about to wreck the entire city. What do you do?`,
  cigZombiePrepperTwice: `"Dude. Is this some kind of joke? This is my 4th year of quitting, and you do this... Fine. We are having a zombie invasion, after all." The Zombie Prepper stands outside the gas station, joined by Bucky Adams. They talk for a while, deep in a philosophical conversation. But since you're a bird, you really couldn’t care less about any of that. You can hear the incoming swarm of zombies, their crawling and moaning growing louder. A foetor creeps into the gas station, the smell thick and suffocating. The tension is palpable. You hop into the next aisle and spot Mr. Heart, the gas station’s mascot, dancing and cheering, blissfully unaware of the impending doom. What do you do?`,
  cigMrHeartTwice: `"Leave my store, right now," Mr. Heart says, "I saw you handing out cigarettes like they're candy. What’s your endgame here?" With a dramatic flourish, he points toward the exit, his gaze regal and unyielding. "Well, whatever it is, I don’t want to see it. Beat it, tweedy bird." Without warning, Mr. Heart kicks you. Ouch! Inside the fridge, Bucky’s voice crackles over the intercom, sharp and urgent. "Attention, customers. The zombies have taken control of the streets. For those of you still here, we will be handing out bats and hammers. Please, if you find room in your heart, help us fend off this impending horde."`,
  cigCasStationClerkTwice: `Everyone laughs and smiles as you peck the clerk’s hand. Smiles explode everywhere and everyone becomes less stressed about the zombie invasion. You flutter along the gas station, pecking everyone as they gear up for combat. `,
